# IOT-BASED-SMART-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
 we will be going to accomplish this project by using Python Networking, BLOB, Haar-Cascade, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi

Problem: The continuous increase in the human population is leading to a rapid increase in traffic in most cities. Traffic management has become a challenging task in most metro cities as maintaining a smooth traffic flow can sometimes get out of hand.

This is one of the most useful beginner-level IoT project ideas. The project involves building a smart traffic management system using IoT to control highway traffic and provide clear pathways for emergency vehicles. These traffic management systems are beneficial for emergencies where the traffic flow needs to be controlled dynamically.

This project can be very helpful for -

*  Municipal corporations in any smart city


To be done :

Traffic Jam Detection: With cloud connectivity, sensors, and CCTV cameras tracking intersections 24×7, technicians can remotely monitor all the streets in real-time from the city’s traffic control room.

Connected Vehicles: A smart traffic system using IoT technology can connect with roadside tracking devices to enable direct communication between intelligent vehicles & intersections.

Modular Control: Real-time detection of congestion triggers dynamic adjustments in the systems meant for controlling traffic lights, express lanes, and entry alarms.
Emergency Navigation: A system with edge data processing & programmatic alerting capabilities can alert response units (police, ambulance & tow trucks) in case of a car crash or collision. It reduces the crucial time an injured driver or passenger remains unattended.

Road Safety Analytics: Systems with pattern detection capabilities can immediately flag high cruising speeds and reckless driver or inappropriate pedestrian behavior.

Digital Payments: Commercial traffic management systems enable quick and convenient electronic transactions in real time while ensuring financial data safety
