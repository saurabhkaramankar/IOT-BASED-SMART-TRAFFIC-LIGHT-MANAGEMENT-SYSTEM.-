Problem: The continuous increase in the human population is leading to a rapid increase in traffic in most cities. Traffic management has become a challenging task in most metro cities as maintaining a smooth traffic flow can sometimes get out of hand.

This is one of the most useful beginner-level IoT project ideas. The project involves building a smart traffic management system using IoT to control highway traffic and provide clear pathways for emergency vehicles. These traffic management systems are beneficial for emergencies where the traffic flow needs to be controlled dynamically.

This project can be very helpful for -

*  Municipal corporations in any smart city
